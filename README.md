## Experience

It was all fairly straightforward, but I had a panic in the middle as my PORT (in the code) was 3001 but my SQL Workbench said 3306, and I was worried it wasn't working. After two hours, I figured they were the same thing since they were populating and functioning. Making the models was fun.
